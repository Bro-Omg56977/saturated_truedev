NOTE ABOUT POTENTIAL COMPATABILITY AND/OR INCOMPATABILITIES:

while there should be little to no incompatabilities for basically anything as far as i can tell, there's a few exceptions that apply to generally anything

MODS THAT ALTER LOOT: Saturated contains some enchantments that are only supposed to be used by certain enemies and bosses. These enchantments (in the enemy folder) could be potentially accessable to survival players when it usually shouldn't be in any circumstance

MODS THAT ALTER OVERWORLD NOISE: i forgot the specific file name, but the saturated dimension uses overworld noises to generate, like temperture, erosion, depth, etc. if a different mod modifies those values, then it will probably also chance how saturated generates

MODS THAT USE THE TEAMS COMMAND: saturated adds certain mobs to teams, and some functions cause players to join or leave teams.

(only sometimes break thinks) MODS THAT USE TAGS OR SCOREBOARDS: Saturated uses alot of scoreboards and tags. like 40+ i think. unfortunatly i didnt have the foresight to label then beforehand (like sat.soul_count instead of just soul_count) so that may cause some weird interactions
