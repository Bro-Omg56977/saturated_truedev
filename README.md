# saturated_truedev
This is, as the name suggests, the version i use to develop Saturated, the minecraft datapack. it can be somewhat broken as i test things within.

more context:



This datapack adds Saturated, a new dimension (and The Void as a bonus)

in a nutshell, this project adds a dimensions with various biomes, structures, and a medicore magic system

in the overworld, get stuck in some gravel or normal sand to teleport to the void dimension. In the void dimension, go through a oak door to go back to the overworld. In the void dimension, use a warped door to go to saturated. in saturated, go through an iron door to go back to the void.

there are about 18 biomes:

16 in Saturated:

-The Enchanted: Is suppose to be an enchanted forest. The bigger trees that tower over the normal ones and have fruit hanging off of them, the normal trees have soul lanterns hanging off of them, and the forest floor has some decorations on it.

-Stranger Flats: Has large "jellyfish" floating in the air, and has shrubs on the ground.

-Bone canyon: A hot desert made out of red sand related blocks. Has bones sticking out of the ground.

-Bone cavern: Bone canyon but cave edition. has trees made out of bone and red blocks with an a lot of shroomlights. ceiling has stuff hanging from it. usually generates at the deeper parts of the world and / or under Bone Canyon.

-Boreal Valley: A thicket of tall spruce trees, along with normal-sized trees. Has occasional lanterns on the ground

-Glacial Carve: an icy cave biome, has a large amount of icicles, packed/blue ice, and small patches of vegetation.

-Moss Basin: Has bushes and trees on the ground. The trees have either vines or droopy leaves and there's massive dead trees.

-Underground Jungle: Lush Caves ++, ceiling has hanging vines and the ground is made out of several blocks, Trees have several variants, and there's occasional 'big roots.'

-Basalt Climb: basically a slopes biome made out of just smooth basalt and Blackstone. has a normal basalt path, which is the only place where the "trees" can grow.

-Freezer: The top of the basalt climb. A peaks biome made of warped wart, powdered snow, and smooth blackstone streaks.

-Crystalized Peaks: A peaks biome made out of stone with Blackstone stripes and crystals coming out of the ground. the crystals occasionally have growstone floating near them.

-Crystalized Cavity: a cave biome inspired by crystalized peaks, has blackstone 'trees' scattered around, with gilded blackstone paths and crystals on the ceiling and floors.

-Oceanic: Think of a warm ocean with even more life. The land that's close to breaching the surface becomes dead coral. The parts that do breach the surface have large dead coral trees that use to grow on them.

-Littoral Hollow: a cave biome that vaguely resembles a swamp mixed with volcanic elements. contains alot of basalt, mud, and strange pillars. oh yeah, and trees

-Sunken Depths: a deep ocean biome that has very tall kelp, along with some ruins of an unknown origin. these ruins can occasionally have ancient debris ontop of them.

-Verdant Spires: very rare ocean biome. made up of very tall stony spikes. covered in moss-related blocks, and looks very cool imo. inspired by lush stacks from BYG

-The River: a generic river biome. if it spreads to land, then it makes bushes.

and 2 in The Void:

-Void: mostly empty, sometimes has pillars of Deepslate Bricks. All items disappear in this biome / dimension. Used as a gateway between dimensions, as you use doors to cross into the overworld or saturated from here. If you didn't bring a door, there's a new funky liminal space structure that has what you're looking for. Just walk around for long enough and you can probably find an entrance to one.

-Inverse: same as the Void, but the ground and fog colors are inversed. very simple.

You can find roads littered around in some biomes, like the enchanted and stranger flats, and almost all biomes have something floating in the air, like glass, ice, lanterns, etc.

There are about nine structured included.

8 in Saturated:

-cave ruins: Generic Small structure that generates at the bottom of the world. Has a chest that always contains an explorer map to another structure

-Sewers: You can find it generating commonly in the enchanted. it's underground, and contains mostly generic undead enemies with equally generic loot.

-Tower of Sloni: A tall structure. generates rarely in The Enchanted. Contains several towers that connect to eachother via bridges, and smaller offshoot rooms. enemies found are mostly powerful illagers, with a miniboss at the top.

-Babel Coven Hideout: A deep structure. Generates rarely in the Stranger Flats. Mostly underground, you can only notice its existence via a small pillar-like tower on the surface. the center of the structure resembles a large library, with many branching hallways and sub-sections. contains trial spawners, and is mostly occupied by witches.

-Prosperous Skeletown: A town-like structure. Generates uncommonly in the Boreal Valley. contains a sprawling town that surrounds a central keep-like structure. The center of the keep seems to have a fountain, containing something locked away... (boss fight) Occupied by mostly skeletons, although some of them seem to have tricks up their sleeve.

-Villantis: a town-like structure (but underwater this time) generates uncommonly in deep Oceanic and Sunken Depths. contains villagers with decently useful trades, explorer maps, and more. occupied by mostly villagers, but heavily defended by enchanted golems and guardians.

Aquarius Digsite: A large, sub aquatic and subterranean structure that generates rarely within of the Sunken Depths. A central drill has several smaller, abandoned housing posts. these bright areas contain lore and sometimes a water-breathing potion. The main part of the structure is what lies below. Beneath the drill are some damaged hallways that twist and turn almost endlessly, with the occasional room and flooded sections. has unique enchantments and a renewable bossfight.

-Sinkhole Ruins: idk it's the largest and rarest structure in the datapack. generates rarely in the Moss basin. Has about... three layers? the first is the ruins, and it generates on the surface. it's mostly ruins of a long gone city, filled with suspicious blocks and decorated blocks, and archaeologists from other factions trying to uncover secrets. at the center is a strange sinkhole. Layer two is the sunken city, which is filled with arching walkways and multi-layered towers. layer 3 is the undercity, which are basements under the towers with a few different sub-sections. also contains a boss fight under the center. occupied mostly by archaeologists from other factions, and the "spectrals" of the original residents of the city.

and 1 in The Void:

-Liminal: A confusing, maze-like structure that generates everywhere within the void. contains no loot, but many liminal spaces to walk through, and some hints as to how to enter saturated and/or return to the overworld.

Paper / Spigot and branches of the two have a chance to not work with the datapack version. This is also unsupported for realms.

This datapack/mod doesnt add any new blocks, or things like that
